# Landing-Page---Odin

This is my first landing page project I am completing through the course 'The Odin Project' so bare with me as its not gonna look all that great. I decided to kind of do my own thing with it by loosely following the template they provided. (This took me forever). Im sure there are many useless things in my CSS but ive only been doing this a week and it'll look better the more I practice.

Hope you like it!
